  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ_104_(L_59)#Africa_flight
    --According to wiki, Sudan was colonized in 1899, so the theory that the African player would be totally
      uncivilized is far fetched, find another country in the flight path of L-59 that's more desolate?
      --Player will be referred to as Sudanese for now

  1. Clip of Germans radioing with Austrian's about South African Zeppelin mission
  2. Indian Jones style map showing zeppelin trip from Germany --> Austria --> Sudan
  3. Clip of British taking over landing zone in SA, screen splits diagonally showing Austrians/German's instructing zeppelin to return home
  4. As blimp anim turns around to head back to Austria, show aerial shot of an Sudanese villager watching it in amazement
  5. Fade into top down?

Game Theory
  - player controls African dude who has never seen tech/civilization in his life
  - Inspired --(aliens / religion) to build some tech or gain culture (2 alt currencies)
  - Religion forms around worshipping the zeppelin
  - It's disappearance is a bad omen that it will return in force (incentive to prepare)

  - player can either 1) develop tech or 2) expand his villager
  - GOAL: is to find the balance between expanding your village and developing tech (third tree of development?)

Environment class
  - As soon as player gets control, a timer counting down until (COUNTRY'S COLONIZATION DATE???) -- in game difficulty between 1-3 hours of play time/prep
  - Once X time has elapsed, White people come to colonize the village, Things Fall Apart style showdown
  - Player loses every time, but score is calculated by their capability to survive

  - Other factors -disease, poor agriculture? etc. impact population and tech speeds

Player class (top down? isometric view? side scroller?)

    - build tech manually
